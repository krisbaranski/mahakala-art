          Mahakala

          “Mahakala is the best known protector in Tibetan Buddhism. Although
          his appearance is powerfully protective, his essence is compassion. He
          conquers hindrances that may appear on the path to enlightenment, and
          appears in various forms, with two, four or six arms. Two-armed forms
          are emanations of Vajrapani (Diamond in Hand eng, Chan na Dor je tib),
          four-armed forms are emanations of Manjushri (Wisdom Buddha eng, Jam
          pal yang tib) and six-armed forms are emanations of Avalokiteshvara
          (Loving Eyes eng, Chen re sig tib). A special form of the two-armed
          Mahakala, particularly honoured in Mongolia, is the Panjara-Mahakala
          (Gor gyi gon po tib), who protects tents and houses.
        </p>
        <p>
          Mahakala’s body colour expresses different emphases of his activity.
          White forms express pacifying and sometimes increasing activity,
          whereas golden or yellow forms express only the increasing activity.
          Red forms express fascinating activity, and the “cutting through”
          protective activity is symbolised by blue or black.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two-armed Mahakala Bernagchen is the powerfully protective
          emanation of Diamond in Hand. He is fully in the service of the
          Karmapa and is the main protector of the Karma Kagyu lineage.
        </p>
        <p>
          The invocation of the protector Black Coat, composed by the 8th
          Karmapa Mikyo Dorje, is a fundamental meditation of the Karma Kagyu
          lineage. When practised daily, the invocation protects from obstacles
          and promotes the development of fearlessness.
        </p>
        <p>
          The two-armed Mahakala Bernagchen has blue-black skin, and is depicted
          in the Karma Kagyu lineage in a jumping posture on a lotus throne with
          a sun disk. The human being (sometimes two) he tramples under his feet
          show that he conquered all disturbances and hindrances. The right hand
          of this powerful form is raised and holds a chopping knife with the
          blade turned away from him. In his left hand he holds a skull bowl
          filled with the blood of the ego in front of his heart. His head is
          one third of his entire height, and topped by flame like hair standing
          on end and a crown of five skulls with a dorje at its peak. Above his
          two natural eyes and bushy eyebrows he bears a vertical wisdom eye on
          his forehead. His snarling mouth shows four fangs, and is framed by a
          flaming orange beard. He wears the ornaments of powerful protection,
          such as jewellery made out of bone and skulls, and is surrounded by
          wisdom flames.”
