      <h3>Mahakala form </h3>
      <br />
      <p>
        The main purpose for this form is to inspire as many people as possible
        with a physical representation of protective qualities of enlightened
        mind.

        This Projekt began with a wish. Since years I wanted to build a Mahakala
        form. From 2006 I learn how to build statues in traditional buddhist
        clay technique which originally comes from Tibet and Ladakh. In this
        technique it is possible to create 3-dimentional statues, ritual dancing
        masks and reliefs (Tsa-tsa tib.).
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The Mahakala form which I show here is a mixture of statue and relief.
        It is also prepared for traditional statuefilling. Once the original
        form is ready, a negative mould is made. This allows to multiply that
        form with the same precision as the original one.

        The material which is use for copies is Zellan (porcelain plaster), very
        hard, fine and best quality material for this kind of work.
      </p>
      <br />

        After the mould copy is ready, it can be painted and prepared for
        filling. Traditionally in the East, stone colours are used. Nowadays
        acrylic colours are well adapted. I’m using very good quality acrylic
        for the form and real gold powder for “opening” the eyes.
      </p>

        Painting the form is inspired by my teacher Lama Ole Nydahl and few very
        good quality Thangkas (tib. for traditional roll paintings) of Mahakala
        in Karma Gadhri Tradition .
