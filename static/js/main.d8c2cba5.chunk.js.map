Although\n          his appearance is powerfully protective, his essence is compassion. He\n          conquers hindrances that may appear on the path to enlightenment, and\n          appears in various forms, with two, four or six arms. Two-armed forms\n          are emanations of Vajrapani (Chan na Dor je tib., Diamond in Hand\n          engl.), four-armed forms are emanations of Manjushri (Jam pal yang\n          tib., Wisdom Buddha engl.) and six-armed forms are emanations of\n          Avalokiteshvara (Chen re sig tib., Loving Eyes engl.). A special form\n          of the two-armed Mahakala , particularly honoured in Mongolia, is the\n          Panjara-Mahakala (Gor gyi gon po tib.) , who protects tents and\n          houses.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          Mahakala’s body colour expresses different emphases of his activity.\n          White forms express pacifying and sometimes increasing activity,\n          whereas golden or yellow forms express only the increasing activity.\n          Red forms express fascinating activity, and the “cutting through”\n          protective activity is symbolised by blue or black.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          The two-armed Mahakala Bernagchen is the powerfully protective\n          emanation of Diamond in Hand. He is fully in the service of the\n          Karmapa and is the main protector of the Karma Kagyu lineage.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          The invocation of the protector Black Coat, composed by the 8th\n          Karmapa Mikyo Dorje, is a fundamental meditation of the Karma Kagyu\n          lineage. When practised daily, the invocation protects from obstacles\n          and promotes the development of fearlessness.\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <p>\n          The two-armed Mahakala Bernagchen has blue-black skin, and is depicted\n          in the Karma Kagyu lineage in a jumping posture on a lotus throne with\n          a sun disk. The human being (sometimes two) he tramples under his feet\n          show that he conquered all disturbances and hindrances. The right hand\n          of this powerful form is raised and holds a chopping-knife with the\n          blade turned away from him. In his left hand he holds a skull-bowl\n          filled with the blood of the ego in front of his heart. His head is\n          one-third of his entire height, and topped by flame-like hair standing\n          on end and a crown of five skulls with a dorje at its peak. Above his\n          two natural eyes and bushy eyebrows he bears a vertical wisdom eye on\n          his forehead. His snarling mouth shows four fangs, and is framed by a\n          flaming orange beard. He wears the ornaments of powerful protection,\n          such as jewellery made out of bone and skulls, and is surrounded by\n          wisdom flames.”\n        </p>\n        <br />\n        <h3>Space & Bliss – Buddhist Statues & Ritual Implements</h3>\n      </div>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default About;\n","const Form = () => {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"container\">\n      <h3>Mahakala form </h3>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        The main purpose for this form is to inspire as many people as possible\n        with a physical representation of protective qualities of enlightened\n        mind.\n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        This Projekt began with a wish. Since years I wanted to build a Mahakala\n        form. From 2006 I learn how to build statues in traditional buddhist\n        clay technique which originally comes from Tibet and Ladakh. In this\n        technique it is possible to create 3-dimentional statues, ritual dancing\n        masks and reliefs (Tsa-tsa tib.).\n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        The Mahakala form which I show here is a mixture of statue and relief.\n        It is also prepared for traditional statuefilling. Once the original\n        form is ready, a negative mould is made. This allows to multiply that\n        form with the same precision as the original one.\n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        The material which is use for copies is Zellan (porcelain plaster), very\n        hard, fine and best quality material for this kind of work.\n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        After the mould copy is ready, it can be painted and prepared for\n        filling. Traditionally in the East, stone colours are used. Nowadays\n        acrylic colours are well adapted. I’m using very good quality acrylic\n        for the form and real gold powder for “opening” the eyes.\n      </p>\n      <br />\n      <p>\n        Painting the form is inspired by my teacher Lama Ole Nydahl and few very\n        good quality Thangkas (tib. for traditional roll paintings) of Mahakala\n        in Karma Gadhri Tradition .\n      </p>\n    </div>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Form;\n","const Footer = () => {\n  return (\n    <footer className=\"footer\">\n      <div className=\"nav\">\n        <li>\n          <a href=\"\">Disclaimer | Impressum</a>\n        </li>\n        <li>\n          <a href=\"\">Privacy Policy</a>\n        </li>\n      </div>\n      <p className=\"nav\">Copyright &copy; 2021</p>\n    </footer>\n  );\n};\n\nexport default Footer;\n","import './index.css';\nimport Header from './components/Header';\nimport Home from './components/Home';\nimport About from './components/About';\nimport Form from './components/Form';\nimport Footer from './components/Footer';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div className=\"App\">\n      <Header />\n      <Home />\n      <About />\n      <Form />\n      <Footer />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import React from 'react';\nimport ReactDOM from 'react-dom';\nimport './index.css';\nimport App from './App';\nimport reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';\n\nReactDOM.render(\n  <React.StrictMode>\n    <App />\n  </React.StrictMode>,\n  document.getElementById('root')\n);\n\n// If you want to start measuring performance in your app, pass a function\n// to log results (for example: reportWebVitals(console.log))\n// or send to an analytics endpoint.
